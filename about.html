            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Access to enough food should be a basic right, but it’s not a reality for over 1.1 million people in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles is home to the greatest number of food-insecure adults and children in the nation. Due to COVID, there are ___ more people who are struggling to find enough food. These are not only people who are experiencing homelessness. This includes everyone.</p>
            <p>No one organization can solve this. It takes a group effort—and that’s where Food Oasis comes in. Food Oasis built a directory to connect anyone with hundreds of free food resources. We also took the extra steps to update the data we have in our directory. Los Angeles now has an updated directory that we will share with our community and partners.</p>

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Food Oasis started in 2015 under <a href="">Hack for LA</a>, a brigade under the non-profit <a href="">Code for America</a>. The goal was to create a site of free and subsidized food resources. The team gave the project to a nonprofit to manage its day-to-day operations. The upkeep turned out to be much more work than any single nonprofit could handle.</p>
            <p>In 2020, our current Hack for LA team assembled to build new digital pieces of this puzzle. One goal was to relaunch the site with hundreds of new food resources. We learned from the past how difficult it is to keep resources updated. Now, we are training volunteers to update the resources in the directory. The final piece we added is a new database that connects pantry directors with food donors.</p>
            <p>Our web-based solution is sparking collaboration, community building, and team building. The result of this community building is the food seeker will have updated data to find the food they need.</p>
            <p>We are 100% volunteer-run project. We look forward to sharing our updated directory with Los Angeles.</p>
